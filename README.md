## Rules:

1. There are `two players`
2. Each player chooses a `token`  ( 🥕 or 🍓)
3. The players `take turns` picking a `number` card or just throw a dice
4. The playing `board` is similar with a classic game of the goose .
5. You get your number and then you `progress` on the board 
6. The positions are representations of `emotions/ sensations/ feelings` 
7. When you move your token on the next position, you have to `recall a situation which makes you feel  like the emotion` in that position
8. For example, if the position has "`Happy`" 😁  on it, you tell a situation which makes you happy: "`I feel happy when ..... `".
9. The first player to get to the end of the board wins.



> Enjoy!
